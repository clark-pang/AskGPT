Ask GPT is a Chrome extension that allows you to select any code snippet you see online and provides you with Chat GPTâ€™s detailed explanation of what that code means and how it works. It also gives you the option of changing the depth of the response, as well as the possibility of translating that code into your preferred language.

User must generate their own OpenAI API key and declare it as API_KEY in popup.js or their env.
